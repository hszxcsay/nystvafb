		<p>We presented them with the newly developed additional goals and criteria and said: - As we expected, management wants to set additional goals for you with even more stringent criteria than before.  I did not get much satisfaction, starting to deal with issues of choosing the direction of development, creating culture, deep analysis of problems and the search for new opportunities.  The fiscal function is the main one, characteristic initially for all states.  At that time, I was doing a lot of "leadership development" [1] with various clients across the country.  They feel insincere and become more cautious and defensive.

Greenery and cleanliness are what we need.  How many marriages, once distinguished by excellent relationships, tenderness and sincerity, are destroyed under the influence of several such cases! The husband and wife see the situation differently.  And only to a limited extent do they give us power and internal security.  Character. </p>

		<p>We saw in him endless layers of possibilities that had to be realized in accordance with his own life rhythm.  This method is based on a paradigm that recognizes self-awareness, imagination, conscience, and the free will of others.  People from a wide variety of professions - doctors, scientists, actors, politicians, professional businessmen, athletes and plumbers - often spend enormous efforts to have more income, more popularity, or to achieve a certain professional level, and then find that their desire to achieve this goal was overshadowed by what is actually much more important to them and what is now forever lost.  They have no idea how to organize delegation in such a way that the other person takes responsibility for achieving results.  The conceptual framework of government regulation is a theory that acquires the status of government doctrine.Alternative conceptual approaches to state redistribution of income can be reduced to the problem of opposing equality and efficiency.  One thing that particularly amazed me was how little time it took to build up a level of trust sufficient to generate such synergy.  Then, using fifteen-minute intervals, write down what you have been doing over the past three days.  increases with a decrease in income, called goods of the lowest category.  Most of us know from our own experience how unreliable such a center is, since it is subject to many forces and can quickly disappear.
